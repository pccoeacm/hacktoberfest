# ___HACKTOBERFEST___

<br>
Hacktoberfest is an event encouraging participation in the open-source community, which grows bigger every year. It is open to everyone in our global community. Whether youâ€™re new to development, a student, long-time contributor, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive the growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge. 
<br>
<br>

PCCOEACM is arranging an eMeetup for explaining everything regarding the fest. The event is scheduled on _3rd October from 11:00am to 04:00pm IST_. Everything will be explained and taught on the day of the event. It's a great chance to learn about opensource collaboration and receive great prizes while learning it.
